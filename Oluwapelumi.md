Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 – NATO Conference on Software Crisis)
In 1968, the term software engineering was first introduced during a NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) conference. The conference addressed the "Software Crisis," where software systems were becoming increasingly complex, leading to project failures, budget overruns, and unreliable software. This event marked the formal recognition of software engineering as a discipline that applies engineering principles to software development.

2. The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s – 1980s)
During the 1970s and 1980s, structured programming emerged as a response to chaotic and unmanageable software development practices. Techniques such as modular programming, top-down design, and the use of control structures like loops and conditionals helped improve code organization and maintainability. Languages like Pascal, C, and Ada were designed to support structured programming, making software development more efficient and less error-prone.

3. The Agile Revolution (2001 – Agile Manifesto)
In 2001, a group of software developers introduced the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid traditional methods like the Waterfall model. Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) became widely adopted, allowing teams to respond to changing requirements more efficiently and deliver software faster. This milestone transformed the software industry by promoting continuous improvement, user feedback, and adaptability.

These milestones have played a significant role in shaping modern software engineering practices, making software development more structured, efficient, and adaptable to evolving technological demands.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

This phase involves gathering and analyzing user and business requirements to define the software’s functionalities, goals, and constraints.
Techniques like interviews, surveys, and document reviews are used to understand what the software must accomplish.

2. Planning:
The development team creates a roadmap for the project, estimating costs, timelines, required resources, and potential risks.
Project management tools and methodologies like Agile or Waterfall are chosen.

3. Design:
Software architecture and system design are created based on the requirements.
UI/UX design, database models, and technical specifications are defined.
Design models like UML diagrams and wireframes are often used.

4. Implementation (Coding & Development):
Developers write the actual code according to the design specifications.
Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are selected based on project needs.
Version control systems (e.g., Git) help manage changes.

5. Testing:
The software is tested to identify and fix defects before deployment.
Types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Automated and manual testing tools are used to ensure functionality, security, and performance.

6. Deployment:
The software is released to users, either as a full launch or a phased rollout.
It may be deployed on cloud servers, local systems, or mobile app stores.
Deployment strategies include blue-green deployment, canary releases, and CI/CD pipelines.

7. Maintenance & Support:
After deployment, regular updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements are carried out.
User feedback is collected to enhance future versions.
Security patches and software updates ensure long-term stability and usability.
